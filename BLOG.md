# Setting up predictive analytics pipelines using Azure SQL Data Warehouse

*This post is by Robert Alexander, Solution Architect at the Machine Learning Team at Microsoft.*

Big data is big and it's getting bigger. Better get used to a whole new set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix">prefixes</a> beyond peta such as exa, zetta, and yotta. The amount of data is projected to increase until by 2020 there will be about 50 zettabytes of data - nearly as many bits as there are stars in the universe.

The sheer size of these data presents both immense opportunities and real challenges to businesses. Having access to these mountains of data - from the internet of things, from applications in the cloud, from mobile devices - will enable businesses to transform data into faster and better decisions. The result? more real-time and user-specific actions, lower costs, lower risks, new products and services - even entirely new businesses.

Managing such a vast amount of data is no trivial matter. How to securely and reliably store the data. How to quickly move and collate data across organization boundaries. How to efficiently analyze the data. Finding the right talent and technologies to handle the quickly evolving technological landscape. Creating the right architecture that fits within the IT budget. These are just some of the questions that must be answered.

Microsoft has been hard at work building solutions in the big data space. The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/cortana-intelligence-suite/what-is-cortana-intelligence.aspx">Cortana Intelligence Suite</a> allows businesses to manage and make use of data at such scale. As a fully managed big data and advanced analytics suite, Cortana Intelligence is a powerful solution to transform your data into intelligent action.

Cortana Intelligence consists of a number of services that can be used to create predictive analytics pipelines. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-data-warehouse-overview-what-is"/>Azure SQL Data Warehouse</a> is a service that provides a cloud-based, scalable database capable of processing massive volumes of data. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/">Azure Machine Learning</a> provides a fully managed cloud service that enables you to easily build, deploy, and share predictive analytics solutions. In addition to these key services, there are several others that are used to ingest, orchestrate, and visualize the data such as <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/"/>Azure Event Hub</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/stream-analytics/"/>Stream Analytics</a>, <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/"/>Power BI</a>, and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-factory/"/>Azure Data Factory</a>.

Used together these services can create powerful end-to-end data pipelines for ingesting, storing, analyzing, and visualizing vast amounts of data. Real time pipelines can be created to allow data to be moved through in seconds where it can be used for alerting and operational statistics. Predictive pipelines can be created to allow data to be moved through in minutes where it can be used for insights.

To demonstrate the power of Cortana Intelligence we have published a <a href="https://github.com/Azure/CAS-Gallery-Content/tree/master/Tutorials/SQL-Data-Warehouse"/>tutorial</a> that shows how to deploy an end-to-end real time and predictive pipeline in your Azure subscription. Along the way you will see in use all of the services listed above - as well as an on-prem SQL Server via a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn879362.aspx"/>Data Management Gateway</a>. Go check it out! You will learn how to add predictive pipelines to a data warehouse augmented with machine learning. At the end of this tutorial you will have a full end-to-end solution deployed in your Azure subscription.

The underlying architecture is as follows:

![annotated-architecture-image](./media/annotated-architecture.png)

This tutorial will cover several useful design patterns that you can use. It consists of a real time and a predictive pipeline. For the real time pipeline, you will see how Stream Analytics can read from an EventHub and send the data to PowerBI for visualization. For the predictive pipeline, you will see how Stream Analytics can also send the data to Azure SQL Data Warehouse, where an Azure Data Factory will call Azure Machine Learning to read the data from the warehouse and send the aggregated results back to the warehouse for visualization in PowerBI. In addition, you will see how historical batch data can be ingested from an on-prem SQL Server via Data Management Gateway to Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

This tutorial simulates four different devices sending their rating of an event (e.g. every few seconds. When everything is successfully deployed and running, the final result will be a PowerBI dashboard showing the ratings of each individual device in real time and the average rating for all devices every few minutes.

So again, click <a href="https://github.com/Azure/CAS-Gallery-Content/tree/master/Tutorials/SQL-Data-Warehouse"/>here</a> to check out the tutorial and get started - and have fun with your journey into big data!

These are all the Cortana Intelligence services used by the tutorial:

![azuresql-image](./media/azuresql.png)
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-data-warehouse-overview-what-is"/>Azure SQL Data Warehouse</a>

A cloud-based, scalable database capable of processing massive volumes of data. It is ideally suited for storing structured data with a defined schema. Due to it's <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh393582%28v=sql.110%29.aspx"/>MPP</a> architecture and use of Azure storage, it provides optimized query performance along with the ability to grow or shrink storage and compute independently. SQL Data Warehouse uses SQL Server's Transact-SQL (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt243830.aspx"/>TSQL</a>) syntax for many operations and supports a broad set of traditional SQL constructs such as stored procedures, user-defined functions, table partitioning, indexes, and collations.

![aml-image](./media/aml.png)<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/">Azure Machine Learning</a>

A fully managed cloud service that enables you to easily build, deploy, and share predictive analytics solutions. You can deploy your model into production as a web service in minutes â€” a web service that can be called from any device, anywhere and that can use any data source.

![eventhub-image](./media/eventhub.png)<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/"/>Azure Event Hub</a>

A highly scalable publish-subscribe service optimized for reliably ingesting high volumes of data.
Event Hubs can process millions of events per second and stream them into multiple applications. This lets you analyze the massive amounts of data produced by your connected devices and applications. Once Event Hubs has collected the data, transform and store it by using any real-time analytics provider or with batching/storage adapters.

![asa-image](./media/asa.png)<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/stream-analytics/"/>Stream Analytics</a>

Lets you rapidly develop and deploy low-cost solutions to gain real-time insights from streaming data from devices, sensors, infrastructure, and applications. Use it for Internet of Things (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things">IoT</a>) scenarios, such as real-time remote management and monitoring or gaining insights from devices like mobile phones and connected cars.

![pbi-image](./media/pbi.png)<a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/"/>Power BI</a>

A cloud-based dashboard and visualization service that provides faster time to insight. It is used for visualizing, exploring, and extracting insights from data. It brings together data from diverse sources to deliver rich, comprehensive views of your business. With Power BI, you can see all of your data in one place and share reports.

![adf-image](./media/adf.png)<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-factory/"/>Azure Data Factory</a>

A globally deployed, fully managed data movement service in the cloud. It enables enterprises to ingest data from multiple on-premises and cloud sources easily, and gets your data where it needs to go. Prepare and partition your data as you ingest it, or apply pre-processing steps.
